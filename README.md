Requests & Donations
--------------------
While I am willing to continue this project and do requests, I have a lot of other things going on. I also don't have much ideas for what more I could add. Therefor, I'd love for people to give me their requests. 

I'd also love it if people donated a few bucks to the project if they really like it. If I get donations, I know people still want me to continue working on this project.

Also, if you have a feature you really urgently need, please donate $5 or more and leave a message about what you want. I'll try to finish such commissions as fast as possible.
