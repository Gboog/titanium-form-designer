Titanium Form Designer
======================
This is a lightweight, portable, easy to use UI designer for the [Titanium Mobile SDK](http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-sdk "Titanium SDK") by [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/ "Appcelerator Home Page").

Everyone is free to use it for whatever purpose without any cost. More about the license of this software below. Feel free to leave requests and I'll see what I can do. Also, everyone is welcome to help with this.

How to use
----------
* Open index.html in your favorite browser or use it online [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1811708/app/titanium-form-designer/index.html "")
* Start designing your screen
* Click the screen title to edit the screen properties
* Click the 'Generate UI' button

Notes & Known Bugs
------------------
* Tabbed Screens have to be done manually
* The dialog window doesn't properly align the dynamically generated controls (especially the onclick textbox when you make buttons)
* The TableView has to receive an array right now, though I have plans to change this once I figure out how I'm going to do it.
